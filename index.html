               <h2>Art Everywhere.</h2>
               <hr />
               <p>Art is everywhere around us no matter how much we try to escape it. Every artificial project is reliant on art so that us humans find it better to look at. Art doesn't necessarily mean aesthetics, but it could also involve deep meaning in perhaps, verbal words or even images, which is another reason why we enjoy it. </p>

            <h2>Physics</h2>
            <hr />
            <p>Similar to art, physics is everywhere around us as well. We don't notice it as much as art because physics isn't idealy a fashion or an aesthetic or even a better way to say it, it doesn't necessarily need to be something we see. Physics instead, is the study of properties between two infamous words, matter and energy and how they act upon, or work alone and together. </p>
